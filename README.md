 # Bar chart with the “Alcohol” category on the horizontal axis and the average of “Malic Acid” for each class on the vertical axis.

  .  initializes an empty object avgData to store the average values of MalicAcid for each distinct value of Alcohol in the AllData array.
   .  iterates through each element in the AllData array and updates the avgData object by calculating the total MalicAcid and the number of samples for each distinct value of Alcohol.
   .  After calculating the average values of MalicAcid for each distinct value of Alcohol, creates an array malicAcid to store the calculated values, and an array alcohalData to store the distinct values of Alcohol.
  . The alcohalData and malicacid arrays are used to populate the x-axis and y-axis data in the chart.
